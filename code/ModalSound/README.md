This directory contains the ModalSound C++ code origniated from [Changxi Zheng](https://github.com/cxzheng/ModalSound)

We only adopt the _ModalSound_ project where the tetrahedral mesh is generated by TetGen.
We also modified the scripts for continuous sound generation.

```
Usage: ./build/bin/click_synth -platform offscreen click.ini
Input: sound configuration file click.ini
Ouput: sound waveform in both .wav and .raw formats
```

The original documentation is as follows:

# ModalSound
This project releases the educational C++ code used at SIGGRAPH 2016 Course "Physically Based Sound for Computer Animation and Virtual Environments".

There are two sub-projects, _IsoStuffer_ and _ModalSound_.

_IsoStuffer_ is an implementation of [[Labelle and Shewchuk 2007]](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/stuffing.pdf). It provides the functionality to construct a tetrahedral mesh from a water-tight triangle mesh.

_ModalSound_ is a demostration of synthesizing rigid body sounds using the modal sound model. It includes the code of computing stiffness and mass matrices from a volumetric mesh and use the precomputed acoustic multipole coefficients to evaluate the acoustic transfer values at runtime.
